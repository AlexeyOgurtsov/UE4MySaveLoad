********* Child-parent object hierarchy.
****** PROBLEM: Child object implements saveable and is child (direct or indirect) of other saveable object.

* When serializing parent of saveable object, SaveLoad_Serialize is to be called for saveable subobject instead of Serialize,
and the native Serialize is not called. PROBLEM: How to implement? The parent object may be non-saveable by itself 
(for example, if it's a struct) - so, how to overload the Serialize method? Or IMySaveable::SaveLoad_Serialize
should use custom object serialization and NOT default Serialize method, and work the graph by itself?

*** SOLUTION 1: In the case of parent-child relationships of saveable objects, saveable parent (direct on indirect)
is responsible for save load of its children by itself. 

So, saveable properties NEVER allowed to be marked with SaveGame. SaveGame-marked properties do may be
instances of IMySaveable interface, however automatic save-load must be disabled for them.
