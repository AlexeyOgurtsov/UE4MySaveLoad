Saveable object handle management

@TODO0: Use saveable handle iteration instead of script interface iteration;
@TODO1: Register only game worlds;

- What about editor worlds?
- Do we encounter objects from old worlds or from only one world?
- How to pass handles: TScriptInterface<...> or simple ptr?
