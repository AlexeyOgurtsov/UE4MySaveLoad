Saveable object handle management
In IMySaveLoadSystem store and return saveable handles instead of saveable objects.

@TODO0: Replace all calls from GetSaveableObjects() to CreateSaveableHandleIterator()
@TODO4: Remove IMySaveable fwd and GetSaveableObjects() from IMySaveLoadSystemInternal

- How to pass handles: TScriptInterface<...> or simple ptr?
