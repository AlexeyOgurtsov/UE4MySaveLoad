*** Info serialization
FName storage?

***************************** Info
*** Info world
1. Map name

*** Info object

2. Is object was presented at the start of the level or was created dynamically?
3. Is object was named manually or object name was generated automatically?

4. Find object by name (in the world)

*** Info destructing object
