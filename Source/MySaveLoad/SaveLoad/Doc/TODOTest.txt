Goal: Improve the system's interface to make it testable and write primary tests.

*** Provide Load/Save interface calls in the main system interface.

******** Testing stuff:
1. ISaveable-derived instance


******** Testing scenes

******** First test scene
1. Create ISaveable-derived class
2. Check ISaveable-derived class is loaded correctly
2.1. Use manual check


******** Testing Base:
1. Save load test base class: see TODO in its file.

******** Design:
** Saver Loader classes: 
* They abstract? Separate functionality into another class.
