Goal: Improve the system's interface to make it testable and write primary tests.

*** Provide Load/Save interface calls in the main system interface.

******** Testing:

******** Design:
** Saver Loader classes: 
* They abstract? Separate functionality into another class.

* If we using FArchive to specify the destination, then this functions cannot be used in blueprint!
* Should we provide UWorld when loading or should the Load/Save functions take the current world by itself?
* Should we load the map within the Load/Save function or should we doing it outside?
